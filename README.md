<h1> Online_Booking_System </h1>
<p>
  The Online Booking System is a console-based Java application that allows users to schedule and manage appointments. Built using core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, and Modular Programming, the system simulates real-world booking functionalities such as:<br>
Creating a new booking<br>
Viewing all bookings<br>
Canceling an existing booking<br>
Each booking stores a user's name, date, and time. The data is stored in a local file (bookings.txt) using Java's file I/O mechanisms, making it persistent even after the program is closed.
